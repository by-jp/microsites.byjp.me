# Things I built many moons ago

I tell stories at [Storytime](http://storytime.byjp.me/)
I built a QR-like [colourful encoding method](http://toys.byjp.me/colourful)
I built a [binary clock](http://clockwise.byjp.me) that tells you the time in an overly efficient way.
I built a [binary calendar](http://clockwise.byjp.me) that counts the 16s intervals since I was born.
